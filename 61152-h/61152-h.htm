<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">THE UNCONQUERABLE</span></h2>
<p>Reporters in the war-smitten countries
of Europe tell us that one effect
of the horrors of death, wounds, and heartbreak
is that the men are turning back to
the churches. Out of the obscene muck
of materialistic force is springing a revaluation
of the spirit in man.</p>
<p>Man is a curious animal. He seems to
give forth his finest product only when
crushed. We expect him to &ldquo;curse God and
die,&rdquo; and suddenly his face lights up with
the heavenly vision.</p>
<p>We loathe poverty and fight disease and
avoid wounds, tyranny, and oppression.
Yet, somehow only when these come, do
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
the rarest flowers appear on the human
bush.</p>
<p>I know a young man, twisted, crippled,
paralyzed, unable to feed or dress himself,
yet who sits daily by his window with a
shining face. He is cheerful, helpful, a
fountain of joy to all who know him. The
boys love to gather in his room at night and
play cards and tell stories. One would
think he would be a gloom and a burden;
he is an uplift. You soon forget his limitations.
You soon cease to pity him, for he
does not pity himself. He does not drain
you; he inspires you.</p>
<p>In how many another family is the sickroom
the shrine of the house. How many
a stricken invalid woman is the resting-place
for her worried husband, the delightful
refuge for her children&rsquo;s cares!</p>
<p>It is not the strong, wealthy, and powerful
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
that always gleam with optimism and
radiate hope. Too often the house of luxury
is the nest of bitterness, boredom, and
snarling. Petulance waits on plenty. Luxury
and cruelty are twins. Success brings
hardness of heart.</p>
<p>The world could get along without its
war lords, millionaires, and big men, with
all their effective virility, better than it
could do without its blind, deaf, hunchbacked,
and bedridden. Some things we get
from the first group, but the things we get
from the second are more needed for this
star-led race.</p>
<p>Little girl, with twisted spine and useless
legs, with eyes always bright with golden
courage, with heart ever high with undaunted
love, we could spare all the proud
beauties of the ballroom or the stage better
than you.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>Their bodies are finer than yours; but
then we are not bodies.</p>
<p>What a strange and strangely magnificent
creature is man! And how proud his
Maker must be of him, for all his faults!
You cannot crush him. Put him in prison
and in its half-light he writes a &ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s
Progress.&rdquo; Strike him blind and he sings
a &ldquo;Paradise Lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Beethoven died, a post-mortem examination
showed that since childhood he
had suffered from an incurable disease, aggravated
by improper medical treatment and
by want of home comfort and proper food.
His liver was shrunk to half its proper size.
He always had family troubles that annoyed
him beyond endurance. His finest
works were produced after he was deaf.
And this was the majestic soul that was
unparalleled master of music, whose art was
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
immeasurable, will be immortal! Yet we
have heard fat artists whine because they
are mistreated!</p>
<p>What a piece of work is man! Too wonderful,
too unconquerable, too divine for
this earth! His home must be among the
stars!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">KINGDOM COME</span></h2>
<p>What do we want? What precisely do
we mean by the Millennium, or the
Golden Age, or Utopia? What sort of
&ldquo;Kingdom Come&rdquo; is it we pray for?</p>
<p>Sit down sometime and think it over;
try to get rid of the vagueness of the idea,
and to determine exactly what conditions
would satisfy you and all of us. The effort
may not be without good results upon your
present notions.</p>
<p>Just as a suggestion let me give one statement
of the kind of Millennium that appeals
to me.</p>
<p>It is that state of society and that perfection
of government in which there shall be
secured for every human being Intellectual
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
Liberty, Equality of Opportunity, Justice in
all Human Relations, and free Spiritual
Fraternity.</p>
<p>This is somewhat like the French motto,
Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, only the terms
are defined a bit, and Justice is added.</p>
<p>First, Intellectual Liberty. The last element
of coercion, direct or indirect, must be
removed from the processes of the mind.
The Ethics of the Intellect must be acknowledged.
The mind must work absolutely unbribed
by expediency, the opinions of others,
fear, or authority. There can be no perfect
unity of love and service that does not rest
on perfect freedom of thought.</p>
<p>There must be entire Equality of Opportunity.
The state ought to see to it that
every baby coming into the world has an
equal start with every other baby. All inheritance
of wealth that interferes with this
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
should be abated. Every child should receive
adequate training for the world&rsquo;s work.
There will never be equality of intelligence,
of physical force, of genius, nor of any
other kind of ability; inequality in these respects
adds zest to life. And the advantages
of personal ability do not cause injustice; it
is custom-buttressed and law-intrenched
privilege, unearned and undeserved yet perpetuated,
that oppresses the world.</p>
<p>Justice is essential. When that comes,
there shall be no more benevolence and
charity as we now practise them. The great
hunger of mankind is not for kindness and
mercy and pity&mdash;it is for justice. When we
have justice we shall have peace, as it is
written: &ldquo;Righteousness and peace kiss
each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lastly, we shall have free Spiritual Fraternity.
The problem of the race is one of
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
fraternizing. We now get together in sects
and nations. Religiously and politically we
as yet feel but faintly the universal breeze.
We do not realize humanity. The human
nerve is feeble. Some day the idea of universal
brotherhood shall burn in the race
with a heat and shine far stronger than the
present sectarian, partisan, and patriotic enthusiasms.</p>
<p>I do not think human nature will have to
be transformed to get these things. It is a
question of vision. We need to see. When
once we understand what we want we will
organize and get it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">THE HUMANITIES VERSUS THE IDEALS</span></h2>
<p>The humanities are the ordinary universal
feelings, such as family affection,
aversion to cruelty, love of justice and of
liberty.</p>
<p>The ideals are the so-called big enthusiasms,
as religion, patriotism, reform, and
the like.</p>
<p>The humanities are sometimes called the
red passions; the ideals the white passions.</p>
<p>The great institutions of the race have
been formed and kept alive by the white passions.
These include churches, political parties,
nations, and various societies and associations,
secret and public.</p>
<p>The progress of mankind has been made
through institutions, embodying ideals,
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
which we may call the centrifugal force. The
humanities have always pulled against this,
and may be termed the centripetal force.</p>
<p>Thus, although great ideals present themselves
to men as beneficial, yet in the carrying
out of them men often become cruel, unjust,
and tyrannical. So the greatest crimes
of earth are committed under the influence
of movements designed to do the greatest
good.</p>
<p>Under the church we have seen persecution,
a ruthless disregard of human feeling,
families torn asunder, opinion coerced, bodies
tortured.</p>
<p>The humanities in time destroyed the
baleful power of the religious ideal, its
dreams of dominance and its inhuman fanaticism.
Plain pity and sympathy battered
down the monstrous structure of iron idealism.
The horrors of the medieval inquisition
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
and the dark intolerance of puritanism
had to yield to the humanities.</p>
<p>Most of the great tragedies have been the
crushing out of human and natural feeling
by some ideal which, once helpful, has become
monstrous. Such were the Greek tragedies,
where men were the victims of the
gods.</p>
<p>War is the colossal force of an ideal, patriotism,
where the check of the humanities
has been entirely cut off.</p>
<p>It is supposed to ennoble men and states.
It has always been the preferred occupation
of the noble class, kings and courtiers, because
the contempt of personal feelings and
the merciless sacrifice of the humanities have
seemed grand and royal.</p>
<p>But by and by war must yield to the eternal
humanities. Sheer human sympathies
will abolish it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>The humanities are peculiarly of the common
people. Therefore they find expression
and come into political effect quickly in democracies.
In the United States, for instance,
the rule of a religious party or the
program of patriotic militarism is impossible.
We have too much red passion to permit
the ascendency of white passions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin,&rdquo; a book of red passion,
sympathy for the negro, overthrew the
&ldquo;white&rdquo; ideals of the slave oligarchy.</p>
<p>The cry of a starving mother, the protest
of wronged workmen, can defeat the apparently
resistless power of massed capital.</p>
<p>One drop of blood outweighs the most
splendid scheme of the theorist.</p>
<p>The history of the world is the unceasing
struggle of the humanities against great
ideals which, crystallized into institutions,
have become inhuman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">PRECEDENT</span></h2>
<p>Precedent is solidified experience. In
the realm of ideas it is canned goods.</p>
<p>It is very useful when fresh ideas are not
to be had.</p>
<p>There are advantages in doing things just
because they always have been done. You
know what will happen. When you do new
things you do not know what will happen.</p>
<p>Success implies not only sound reasoning,
but also the variable factor of how a thing
will work, which is found out only by trying
it.</p>
<p>Hence, the surest road to success is to use
a mixture of precedent and initiative. Just
how much of each you will require is a matter
for your judgment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>To go entirely by precedent you become
a mossback. You are safe, as a setting hen
or a hiving bee is safe. Each succeeding
generation acts the same way. There is a
level of efficiency, but no progress.</p>
<p>Boards, trustees, and institutions lay great
stress upon precedent, as they fear responsibility.
To do as our predecessors did shifts
the burden of blame a bit from our
shoulders.</p>
<p>The precedent is the haven of refuge for
them that fear to decide.</p>
<p>Courts of law follow precedent, on the
general theory that experience is more just
than individual decision.</p>
<p>Precedent, however, tends to carry forward
the ignorance and injustice of the past.</p>
<p>Mankind is constantly learning, getting
new views of truth, seeing new values in
social justice. Precedent clogs this advance.
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
It fixes and perpetuates the wrongs of man
as much as the rights of man.</p>
<p>Hence, while the many must trust to precedent,
a few must always endeavor to break
it, to make way for juster conclusions.</p>
<p>Precedent is the root, independent thinking
is the branch of the human tree. Our
decisions must conform to the sum of human
experience, yet there must be also the
fresh green leaf of present intelligence.</p>
<p>We cannot cut the root of the tree and expect
it to live, neither can we lop off all the
leafage of the tree and expect it to live.</p>
<p>The great jurist, such as Marshall, is one
who not only knows what the law is, but
what the law ought to be. That is, to his
knowledge of precedent he adds his vision
of right under present conditions.</p>
<p>Precedent is often the inertia of monstrous
iniquity. War, for instance, is due
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
to the evil custom of nations who go on in
the habit of war-preparedness. The problem
of the twentieth century is to batter
down this precedent by the blows of reason,
to overturn it by an upheaval of humanity.</p>
<p>Evil precedent also lurks in social conditions,
in business, and in all relations of human
rights. The past constantly operates to
enslave the present.</p>
<p>We must correct the errors of our fathers
if we would enable our children to correct
ours.</p>
<p>Our reverence for the past must be continually
qualified by our reverence for the
future.</p>
<p>We are on our way to the Golden Age.
The momentum of what has been must be
supplemented by the steam of original conviction,
and guided by the intelligence and
courage of the present.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">THERE IS NO LABORING CLASS</span></h2>
<p>It cannot too often be stated that the labor
problem is not a class affair, but that it
concerns the entire human race. There may
be a class of aristocrats, of plutocrats, of
criminals, of society idlers, or of any such
group whose instinct is to withdraw itself
from the common mass of humanity. But
for laborers this is an impossibility. They
remain, and must remain, part and parcel of
the whole people. They are the people. There
can be no laboring class. It is a contradiction
of terms.</p>
<p>Especially is this true in America, where
from the President of the country down to
the coal-heaver everybody is supposed to
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
work. So strong is this supposition, that
the inference is that whoever does not bear
some part of the world&rsquo;s burden is a diseased
unit in humanity. The ultimate aim of
all normal progress in social justice is to remove
these units. All who have wealth in
excess of a reasonable accumulation of the
products of their own labor, all who live on
endowment and inheritance, all who are sycophants,
idlers, or holders of sinecures,
must some day, when the terms of justice
shall have been worked out, be put to work,
and those who will not work shall not eat.</p>
<p>Just by what route the millennial state of
simple equity shall come we cannot say, but
come it surely will, and the profits of individual
labor of brawn or brain shall go to
the individual, and the profits arising from
the state or social combination shall go to
the state, to the people as a whole.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>One of the most far-reaching acts of 1914
was the statement by the national congress,
in its passage of the anti-trust law preventing
the use of the Sherman act against trade
unions, that &ldquo;the labor of a human being is
not a commodity or article of commerce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The implications of this declaration it will
be difficult to see for some time. It seems
now to strike a blow at the very centre of
the old system of business under which the
world has operated for some six thousand
years.</p>
<p>It means that humanity does not consist
of employers and endowed persons, of
nobles, wealthy people, and professional
men&mdash;doctors, lawyers, priests, and squires;
that culture, schools, courts, and senates are
not for these only, and that the employed,
the clerks, and workmen, who make the
money for these upper classes, are not on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
same economic level as the spades and pens
they handle; but that a man; any man, and
his wage are direct concern of government;
that the iron law of supply and demand may
govern the grinding of flour, but not of human
creatures, and that the brute law of
competition shall some time, in some way,
be changed to the human law of co-operation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">THE PATH TO PERFECTION</span></h2>
<p>The path to perfection, it has been said,
leads through a series of disgusts.</p>
<p>The sinner is converted not when he reforms,
but when he experiences revulsion.</p>
<p>Dr. Chalmers defined the renovating force
as the &ldquo;expulsive power of a new affection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Any form of pleasure carries with it a
sickening element after it passes a certain
point.</p>
<p>The drunkard is not really cured until the
smell of liquor repels him.</p>
<p>The smoker has not broken off his bad
habit for good until tobacco nauseates him.</p>
<p>You are never free from a thing as long
as you like it.</p>
<p>The woman who claims to have reformed,
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
but who still likes to play with fire, lies; lies
to herself probably as much as to you.</p>
<p>Disgust is the shadow cast by love. Where
there is no shadow there is no substance.</p>
<p>The worth of a wife&rsquo;s affection is exactly
measured by her horror of disloyalty.</p>
<p>We climb by love; the rungs of the ladder
are disgusts.</p>
<p>All adepts in soul matters have recognized
the purifying and strengthening quality of
renunciation. It is the gist of Buddhism.
It is the meat of Christianity. It is the core
of all important philosophies.</p>
<p>The wise of this world are they that avoid
satiety.</p>
<p>The motto of Socrates was, &ldquo;Never too
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The epicures of pleasure are those who
are experts in the art of quitting.</p>
<p>The joys of wine are for those who know
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
how to take a little. Those who drink all
they want are wretched.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Dial&rdquo; gives an extract from Bronson
Alcott&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fruitlands,&rdquo; which sheds light
upon the serious problem of enjoying one&rsquo;s
self.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;On a revision of our proceedings it would
seem that if we were in the right course in
our particular instance, the greater part of a
man&rsquo;s duty consists in leaving alone much
that he is in the habit of doing. It is a fasting
from the present activity, rather than an
increased indulgence in it, which, with patient
watchfulness, tends to newness of life. &lsquo;Shall
I sip tea or coffee?&rsquo; the inquiry may be. No;
abstain from all ardent, as from alcoholic,
drinks. &lsquo;Shall I consume pork, beef, or mutton?&rsquo;
Not if you value health and life. &lsquo;Shall
I stimulate with milk?&rsquo; No. &lsquo;Shall I warm
my bathing-water?&rsquo; Not if cheerfulness is
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
valuable. &lsquo;Shall I clothe in many garments?&rsquo;
Not if purity is aimed at. &lsquo;Shall I prolong
my hours, consuming animal oil and losing
bright daylight in the morning?&rsquo; Not if a
clear mind is an object. &lsquo;Shall I teach my
children the dogmas inflicted on myself, under
the pretense that I am transmitting
truth?&rsquo; Nay, if you love, intrude not these
between them and the spirit of all truth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whether or not we accept the rigor of
these conclusions, certain it is that the only
way to mount to perfection is by stepping
upon our dead selves; the only way to a
pleasure that is full of contentment is to
have plenty of lively disgusts for pleasures
of a lower order.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">THE IDEAL WOMAN</span></h2>
<p>The ideal woman is lovable. She may
not be beautiful of face, but she has
charm.</p>
<p>She is attractive to men, not repellent.</p>
<p>She is the appeal of Nature. She draws
men as the sun draws planets.</p>
<p>Her power is deep, cosmic, as strong and
as mysterious as gravitation.</p>
<p>She is the embodiment of love, which is
the most persistent, evergreen, and irresistible
of human motives.</p>
<p>However forceful her individuality she
cannot lose her strange drawing power.</p>
<p>She is passionate, but differs from her
weakling sisters in that her passion is unswervingly
loyal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>All the cumulative morality of centuries
of conscience centers in her love.</p>
<p>She clings, not from subservience, but
from a loyalty as intense as sex itself.</p>
<p>She is free. No man owns her soul nor
body. She gives, as sovereign queens give.
She cannot barter as commoner women barter,
she cannot obey as slaves obey, she cannot
yield as cowards yield.</p>
<p>She is void of egotism; she is full of self-reverence.</p>
<p>She is happy in girlhood, contented in
wifehood, glorified in motherhood.</p>
<p>She is proud to be a woman. She does
not want to be a man.</p>
<p>She has wisdom. In every crisis her husband
is guided by her instinct.</p>
<p>She has character. She secretly moulds
the natures of her children. She is the power
behind each one of them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>She is the flowering rose-bush in times of
pleasure. She is a high tower in times of
trouble.</p>
<p>Her eyes are full of understanding. She
knows the feeling back of your words.</p>
<p>Her smile is as the reward of heaven. It
is worth more than gold.</p>
<p>She is intelligent as no man is intelligent.</p>
<p>She is brave as no man is brave.</p>
<p>Her vision has that clairvoyance that is
bestowed upon no man.</p>
<p>She is variable as water; but as the water
of the unfailing spring, of the eternal ocean,
changing forever, forever fixed.</p>
<p>She is the best inheritance from the world
that was. She is the matrix of the world to
come.</p>
<p>In proportion as men look up to her they
grow unafraid and wise. When they look
down on her, as they treat her with contempt
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
or indifference, they become weak and cruel.</p>
<p>She is not the champion of religious doctrine;
she is the incarnation of the religious
instinct.</p>
<p>She is the ladder by the brook where man
dreams; she reaches to heaven; upon the
rungs of her soul angels ascend and descend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">NO</span></h2>
<p>No is next to the shortest word in the
English language.</p>
<p>It is the concentrated Declaration of Independence
of the human soul.</p>
<p>It is the central citadel of character, and
can remain impregnable forever.</p>
<p>It is the only path to reformation.</p>
<p>It is the steam-gauge of strength, the
barometer of temperament, the electric indicator
of moral force.</p>
<p>It is an automatic safety-first device.</p>
<p>It has saved more women than all the
knights of chivalry.</p>
<p>It has kept millions or young men from
going over the Niagara Falls of drunkenness,
profligality, and passion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>It is the updrawn portcullis and barred
gate of the castle of self-respect.</p>
<p>It is the dragon that guards beauty&rsquo;s
tower.</p>
<p>It is the high fence that preserves the innocence
of the innocent.</p>
<p>It is the thick wall of the home, keeping
the father from folly, the mother from indiscretion,
the boys from ruin, and the girls
from shame.</p>
<p>It is the one word you can always say
when you can&rsquo;t think of anything else.</p>
<p>It is the one answer that needs no explanation.</p>
<p>The mule is the surest footed and most
dependable of all domestic animals. No is
the mule-power of the soul.</p>
<p>Say it and mean it.</p>
<p>Say it and look your man in the eye.</p>
<p>Say it and don&rsquo;t hesitate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>A good round No is the most effective of
known shells from the human howitzer.</p>
<p>In the great parliament of life the Noes
have it.</p>
<p>The value of any Yes you utter is measured
by the number of Noes banked behind
it.</p>
<p>Live your own life. Make your own resolutions.
Mark out your own program.
Aim at your own work. Determine your
own conduct. And plant all around those an
impregnable hedge of Noes, with the jaggedest,
sharpest thorns that grow.</p>
<p>The No-man progresses under his own
steam. He is not led about and pushed
around by officious tugboats.</p>
<p>The woman who can say No carries the
very best insurance against the fires, tornadoes,
earthquakes, and accidents that threaten
womankind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>Be soft and gentle as you please outwardly,
but let the centre of your soul be a No,
as hard as steel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">TIME</span></h2>
<p>Old Father Time knows more than anybody.</p>
<p>He solves more problems than all the
brains in the world.</p>
<p>More hard knots are unloosed, more tangled
questions are answered, more deadlocks
are unfastened by Time than by any
other agency.</p>
<p>In the theological disputes that once raged
in Christendom neither side routed the
other; Time routed them both by showing
that the whole subject did not matter.</p>
<p>After the contemporaries had had their
say, Time crowned Homer, Dante, Wagner,
Shakespeare, Whitman, Emerson.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Almost any judgment can be appealed,
but from the decision of Time there is no
appeal.</p>
<p>Do not force issues with your children.
Learn to wait. Be patient. Time will bring
things to pass that no immediate power can
accomplish.</p>
<p>Do not create a crisis with your husband,
your wife. Wait. See what Time will do.</p>
<p>Time has a thousand resources, abounds
in unexpected expedients.</p>
<p>Time brings a change in point of view,
in temper, in state of mind which no contention
can.</p>
<p>When you teach, make allowance for
Time. What the child cannot possibly understand
now, he can grasp easily a year
from now.</p>
<p>When you have a difficult business affair
to settle, give it Time, put it away and see
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
how it will ferment, sleep on it, give it as
many days as you can. It will often settle
itself.</p>
<p>If you would produce a story, a play, a
book, or an essay, write it out, then lay it
aside and let it simmer, forget it a while,
then take it out and write it over.</p>
<p>Time is the best critic, the shrewdest adviser,
the frankest friend.</p>
<p>If you are positive you want to marry a
certain person, let Time have his word. Nowhere
is Time&rsquo;s advice more needed. Today
we may be sure, but listen to a few tomorrows.</p>
<p>You are born and you will die whenever
fate decides; you have nothing to do with
those fatal two things; but in marriage, the
third fatality, you have Time. Take it.</p>
<p>Do not decide your beliefs and convictions
suddenly. Hang up the reasons to cure.
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
You come to permanent ideas not only by
reasoning, but quite as much by growth.</p>
<p>Do not hobble your whole life by the immature
certainties of youth. Give yourself
room to change, for you must change, if you
are to develop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Learn to labor and&mdash;to wait!&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">SALESMANSHIP</span></h2>
<p>Every young man should some time in
his life have experience in salesmanship.</p>
<p>Selling goods is the best known cure for
those elements in a man that tend to make
him a failure.</p>
<p>The art of success consists in making people
change their minds. It is this power
that makes the efficient lawyer, grocer, politician,
or preacher.</p>
<p>There are two classes of men. One seeks
employment in a position where he merely
obeys the rules and carries out the desires
of his employer. There is little or no opportunity
for advancement in this work.
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
You get to a certain point and there you
stick.</p>
<p>Such posts are a clerkship in a bank, a
government job, such as letter-carrier, a
place in the police force, or any other routine
employment requiring no initiative.
These kinds of work are entirely honorable
and necessary. The difficulty is, they are
cramping, limiting.</p>
<p>Some day you may have to take a position
of this sort, but first try your hand at
selling things.</p>
<p>Be a book-agent, peddle washing-machines,
sell life-insurance, automobiles, agricultural
implements, or peanuts.</p>
<p>You shrink from it because it is hard, it
goes against the grain, as you are not a
pushing sort of fellow. And that is the
very reason you need it.</p>
<p>Salesmanship is strong medicine. You
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
have to go out and wrestle with a cold and
hostile world. You are confronted with indifference,
often contempt. You are considered
a nuisance. That is the time for
you to buck up, take off your coat, and go
in and win.</p>
<p>A young lawyer will gain more useful
knowledge of men and affairs by selling
real estate or fire-insurance than by law-school.</p>
<p>I have just read a letter from an office
man fifty-seven years old. He has lodged
at $1,600 a year for twenty years, while
two of the salesmen who entered the business
about the time he did own the concern.</p>
<p>Get out and sell goods. Hustle. Fight.
Don&rsquo;t get fastened in one hole. Take
chances. Come up smiling. So the best
and biggest prizes in America are open to
you.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>Selling things, commercialism, business,
is not a low affair; it is a great, big, bully
game. It is a thoroughly American game,
and the most sterling qualities of Americanism
are developed by it, when it is carried
on fairly and humanely.</p>
<p>There is incitement in it for all your best
self, for your honesty, perseverance, optimism,
courage, loyalty, and religion. Nowhere
does a MAN mean so much.</p>
<p>I mean to cast no slurs upon faithful occupants
of posts of routine. They have
their reward.</p>
<p>But, son, don&rsquo;t look for a &ldquo;safe&rdquo; place.
Don&rsquo;t depend upon an organization to hold
your job for you. Don&rsquo;t scheme and wire-pull
for influence and help and privilege.</p>
<p>Get out and peddle maps. Make people
buy your chickens or your essays. Get in
the game. It beats football.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">THE INWARD SONG</span></h2>
<p>The poet speaks of those</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t2">&ldquo;Who carry music in their heart</p>
<p class="t0">Through dusty lane and wrangling mart,</p>
<p class="t0">Plying their daily task with busier feet,</p>
<p class="t0">Because their secret souls a holier strain repeat.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>It would be interesting to have the statistics
of what number, out of all the human
stream that pours into the city every morning
coming to their work, are singing inwardly.</p>
<p>How many are thinking tunefully? How
many are moving rhythmically? And how
many are going, as dead drays and carts,
rumbling lifelessly to their tasks?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>It is good that the greater part of the
world is in love. For love is the Song of
Songs. To the young lover Nature is transformed.
Some Ithuriel has touched the
deadly commonplace; all is miraculous. The
moon, the dead companion to our earth, the
pale and washed-out pilgrim of the sky, has
been changed into a silver-fronted fairy
whose beams thrill him with a heady enchantment.
Every breeze has its secret. The
woods, the houses, all men and women are
notes of that sweet harmony that fills him.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Orpheus with his lute made trees,</p>
<p class="t0">And the mountain tops that freeze,</p>
<p class="t0">Bow their heads when he did sing.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Every man is an Orpheus, so he but carry
about in him an inward melody. There is
for him &ldquo;a new heaven and a new earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This world is an insolvable puzzle to human
reason. It is full of the most absurd
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
antinomies, the most distressing cruelties,
the most amazing contradictions. No wonder
men&rsquo;s minds take refuge in stubborn
stoicism, in agnosticism, in blank unfaith.</p>
<p>There is no intellectual faith, no rational
creed, no logical belief. FAITH COMES
ONLY THROUGH MUSIC. It is when
the heart sings that the mind is cleared.
Then the pieces of the infinite chaos of
things drop into order, confusion ceases,
they march, dance, coming into radiant concord.</p>
<p>Marcus Aurelius, that curious anomaly of
the Roman world, perfect dreamer in an age
of iron, was rich in inner music. The
thought in him beamed like a ray of creative
harmony over the disordered crowd of men
and events.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome all that comes,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;untoward
though it may seem, for it leads you
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
to the goal, the health of the world order.
Nothing will happen to me that is not in
accord with nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>None but so noble a mind can see a noble
universe, a noble humanity, a noble God.</p>
<p>What a drop from such a level to the place
of the mad sensualists and pleasure-mongers
who only know</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;To seize on life&rsquo;s dull joys from a strange fear,</p>
<p class="t0">Lest losing them all&rsquo;s lost and none remains!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>What a whirl of cabaret music, what motion
and forced laughter, what wild discord
of hot viands, drugged drinks, and myriad-tricked
lubricity it takes to galvanize us
when our souls are dry and cracked and
tuneless!</p>
<p>Have you ever had the feelings of Hazlitt?
&ldquo;Give me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the clear blue
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
sky over my head and the green turf beneath
my feet, a winding road before me, and a
three hours&rsquo; march to dinner&mdash;and then to
thinking! I laugh, I run, I leap, I sing for
joy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whoever does something that makes the
souls of men and women sing within them
does more to make this earth habitable and
this life tolerable than all the army of them
that widen our comforts and increase our
luxuries.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">IDLENESS THE MOTHER OF PROGRESS</span></h2>
<p>Idleness is the mother of progress. So
long as men were busy they had no
time to think of bettering their condition.</p>
<p>Idleness is the mother of art. It was
when men had leisure from the chase that
they decorated the handles of their hunting-knives
and the walls of their cave-dwellings.</p>
<p>Idleness is the mother of religion. It is
in the relax and rebound from toil that men
think of God.</p>
<p>We talk of all men&rsquo;s right to work. There
is a deeper right than that. It is the right
to idleness.</p>
<p>The value of what we put upon the page
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
of life depends upon the width of the margin.</p>
<p>The great, useful, redeeming, and lasting
work of the world is that work which
is a reaction from idleness. The continent
of labor is barren. It is the little island of
labor that is green and fruitful in the sea of
leisure.</p>
<p>The curse of America is its deification of
labor. Our little gods are the men who are
ceaselessly forthputting.</p>
<p>Most of all we deify capital, which never
rests, but goes on producing day and night.</p>
<p>We are so occupied in getting ready to
live that we have lost the art of living.</p>
<p>With us a man is a fool if he sets about
to enjoy himself before he has laid up a fortune.
We count the woman happy when she
has married money, and the child accursed
when he has no inheritance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>Every morning we arise from our beds
and charge bloodthirstily into the struggle.
We all do it, millionaires and paupers. In
his office the trust magnate sits at his scheming
until his nerves are loosed, his arteries
hardened, and his soul caked. The slaves
of Rome never worked so hard as many of
our laborers in mines and factories.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the Semitic fashion,&rdquo; says Remy
de Goncourt, &ldquo;you make even the women
work. Rich and poor, all alike, you know
nothing of the joys of leisure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There ought to be two leisure classes, yea
three: all children under twenty-one, all
women, and all men over sixty.</p>
<p>The work of the world could be easily
done by males between the ages of twenty-one
and sixty. To accomplish this, all that is
needed is to abolish militarism, that insane
burden of men in idleness, abolish all piled-up
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
wealth-units that keep husky males workless,
and abolish our worship of activity.</p>
<p>Then there would be plenty of work for
every man to keep him from want, and
plenty of leisure for every man to preserve
in him a living soul.</p>
<p>If I were czar of the world, no woman
should work except as she might elect for
her amusement; no child should do aught
but play.</p>
<p>Among savages the women do all the
work. In the coming civilization they shall
do none. The progress of the race is the
progress of the female from toil to leisure.</p>
<p>Every woman is a possible mother. She
should have only to grow and to be strong.
She should be the real aristocracy, the real
Upper Class, to give culture and beauty to
life. She should have time to attend to the
duties of her eternal priesthood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>As for man, little by little, he also would
lift himself from the killing grind of monotonous
exertion. For he would make
Steam and Electricity, and other giants not
yet discovered, do the dirty work.</p>
<p>To bring all this to pass, you do not need
to devise any cunning scheme of government,
nor to join any party or specious ism.
You need do only one thing.</p>
<p>And that is to establish Justice.</p>
<p>The end of fraud and wrong is fevered
toil. The end of justice is the superior
product of skill and genius, and their
mother, leisure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">SELF-CURE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;How,&rdquo; writes a lady to me, &ldquo;can I remove
the following difficulties from
my path?</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I overcome the lazy habit of
oversleeping in the morning&mdash;laziness in
general, in fact?</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I overcome the fear and worry
habit?</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I &lsquo;let go&rsquo; of the thoughts of
past disappointments, mistakes, etc? I have
tried all manner of ways to divert my mind
by work and study.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you believe in confession, in the case
of a non-Catholic, for the purpose of relieving
the mind?</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I overcome prejudice? I find
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
I am prejudiced against certain sects and
races.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rather a stiff task, to answer all these
questions. Of course, I cannot &ldquo;answer&rdquo;
them fully. All I or any one can do is to
give a few hints which may be useful.</p>
<p>Oversleeping is not necessarily laziness.
Go to bed earlier, if you have to rise at a
certain hour. It&rsquo;s a safe rule to take all the
sleep you can get. The rule in my own
family is, &ldquo;Let the sleepy sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laziness is not a bad quality always. A
lazy body often houses a most energetic
mind. The real cure for physical laziness
is fun; find some form of exercise that
lures you. Mental laziness is a more difficult
disease, and you can only cure it by
taking yourself severely in hand. Usually,
I should say, it is hopeless.</p>
<p>Fear can generally be mitigated, if not
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
altogether removed, by intelligence. It is a
by-product of ignorance, as a rule. We are
afraid of what we don&rsquo;t know. Science
(knowledge) has done much to alleviate
superstition (ignorance).</p>
<p>Worry can only be remedied by adopting
some rational theory of life, some common-sense
philosophy. Maeterlinck and Emerson
have done me more good, as worry-antidotes,
than any other masters.</p>
<p>How to &ldquo;let go&rdquo; of bedevilling thoughts
is a hard problem. Thoughts that burn,
stew, ferment, and torment&mdash;who has not
suffered from them? About all I can do is
to let them run their course. I say, &ldquo;This
too shall pass!&rdquo; and try to bear up against
the pestiferous imaginings and memories
until they wear themselves out.</p>
<p>It is also a good idea to have some attractive,
interesting, fascinating vision, of a
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
pleasant nature, to which we can turn our
minds when annoying suggestions persist.
The author of &ldquo;Alice in Wonderland&rdquo; (who
was a great mathematician) used to work
out geometrical tasks, which he called &ldquo;pillow
problems&rdquo; (and wrote a book of that
name), to get himself to sleep. Can&rsquo;t you
find some alluring things to think of when
wooing slumber? Call for them, and by
and by they will come.</p>
<p>Do I believe in confession? Nothing can
so purge the soul. Still, it must be exercised
with the extremest care, judgment,
and discretion, else you may harm others in
pacifying yourself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I overcome prejudices against
such and such sects or races?&rdquo; Just repeat
over and over to yourself that all prejudice
is stupid and ignorant. By and by you will,
by auto-suggestion, get it into your subconsciousness
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
that prejudice shall have no
place in you.</p>
<p>Prejudice means &ldquo;judging before&rdquo; you
have the facts. Never judge till after you
have the facts.</p>
<p>Nothing is so utterly devoid of reason as
a passionate hatred of any race or class. All
men are much the same when you come to
know them. Class or race faults are superficial.
The human qualities strike deep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">PERSONAL INFLUENCE</span></h2>
<p>Of all the forces that drive human beings,
the greatest is personal influence.</p>
<p>By personal influence I mean that force
that goes out from you, simply by virtue of
what you are. It has nothing to do with
what you do or say or try, except as these
things express what you are.</p>
<p>Every person sends out what we might
call dynamic rays or invisible electric-like
impulses which are of such nature as to
affect other persons. These rays from me
can make other individuals gay or sad, good
or bad, and so forth.</p>
<p>This is the only power that pulls souls,
the only wind that bends them, the only fire
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
that warms them, the only stream that bears
them along.</p>
<p>Emerson said that &ldquo;what you are preaches
so loudly that I cannot hear what you say&rdquo;;
which is a striking way of stating that one&rsquo;s
unconscious influence far outreaches in
effect one&rsquo;s conscious effort.</p>
<p>It would be well if we would keep this in
mind; it would save us a lot of futile busying.</p>
<p>For instance, reformers bent on saving the
world should not be so hot and impatient
seeing that there is no real saving that ever
has been or ever will be done that is not the
result of the influence radiating from good
people.</p>
<p>Laws are dead and wooden, but when a
man incarnates a law it begins to work on
other men. The &ldquo;Word&rdquo; is of no force
until it is &ldquo;made Flesh.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>It is the personal influence of a teacher
that affects all the real educating of the
pupil. The wise man understood this who
said that the best university was &ldquo;a log with
Mark Hopkins on one end and me on the
other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I sometimes doubt if any real good has
ever been done by didactic teaching or
preaching. All the moral maxims in the
world are poor beside one strong, sweet, normal
life. And a good woman is worth, as
a guide, the most select list of &ldquo;virtues and
their opposite vices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To create such a character in fiction as
&ldquo;John Halifax&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jean Valjean&rdquo; or &ldquo;Little
Nellie&rdquo; or the man in the &ldquo;Third Floor
Back,&rdquo; is to exert a lasting and potent uplift
agency, better than a thousand sermons.</p>
<p>It is fascinating to many minds, the idea
of &ldquo;doing good&rdquo; and &ldquo;working for the
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
Lord,&rdquo; and devoting one&rsquo;s time wholly to inducing
people to become better; but it is not
practical. The only way to improve mankind
is to be something that inspires them;
your argument and exhortation are of small
avail. Just as the only way to dispel darkness
is to shine, and the only way to electrify
iron is to be a magnet.</p>
<p>Goodness is a contagion; we must &ldquo;catch&rdquo;
it, we must have it and &ldquo;give&rdquo; it.</p>
<p>When you say in your creed that you believe
in God, your declaration is of no help
to you or to others unless what you mean is
this: That you believe in the inherent potency
of goodness, that it will live down,
outwear, and destroy evil; that justice, cleanliness,
honesty, and kindness will win in the
long run against fraud, dirt, lying, and
cruelty; and that persons who are upright
and altruistic get more joy out of every
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
minute of their lives than idle, sporty, and
self-coddling folk; and that there is altogether
a vast tidal or subterranean movement
in the human race toward health,
strength, and beauty.</p>
<p>Therefore why worry over what you will
say or do, since it makes no matter? Simply
BE right, and then say whatever comes to
your mind, and do whatever comes to your
hand, and you cannot fail to do the most
possible toward helping along.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">MONEY-MAKERS</span></h2>
<p>Anybody can save; only a few can
make money.</p>
<p>All you have to do, to save money, is to
spend less than you get. And any human
being that is healthy and &ldquo;compos mentis&rdquo;
can live on, say, nine-tenths of what he is
now living on and put by the other tenth.
There may be exceptions to this rule; we
must grant that for the severely accurate,
but they are scarce as hen&rsquo;s teeth. It is safe
to say that those who say they need every
cent of what they make, and that it is impossible
to save anything at all, are victims
of self-pity, weak will, and bad management.</p>
<p>And saving money is about all that most
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
of us can do. And that makes few rich.</p>
<p>If I make ten dollars a week I can lay
aside one dollar. If I make a thousand dollars
a week I may bank nine hundred and
ninety dollars of it (though I certainly
would not). But in either case I wouldn&rsquo;t
get rich.</p>
<p>Rich people are not those who earn large
salaries. They are those who handle money,
who make money earn money.</p>
<p>Of course, in this argument we exclude
two classes&mdash;those who have money given
them, by inheritance or otherwise, and those
who get money by chance. These two
classes merely step into money some one
else has made.</p>
<p>But very few people get rich, for the
simple reason that money-making requires a
certain order of genius. Money-makers are
born. They have a natural gift.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>They are like poets, mechanicians, orators,
artists, in that they are endowed by
their Creator with a peculiar capacity.</p>
<p>The money-makers are the real kings of
modern life, because vulgarly we measure
all things, including human worth, by
dollars.</p>
<p>If you make ten thousand dollars a year
at your job it is only because your employer
is making more than that amount out of
your services. He is the player; you are
the chessman. He is the general; you are
the private.</p>
<p>The best thing for us workers to do is to
let money-making alone. Nine times out of
ten when we go into that game we are stung.</p>
<p>Wall Street is strewn with the corpses of
lambs who thought they could outwit the
cunning old wolves that hunt there.</p>
<p>Many a shopkeeper has been ruined trying
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
to get rich, not realizing that he is not
a money-maker, but a money-earner.</p>
<p>And many and many a widow has lost all
her insurance money by imagining that, being
possessed of a tidy lump sum, she could
increase it rapidly by shrewd investment.
She does not understand that in speculating
in real estate or buying stocks she is pitting
her inexperience against genius and trained
ability.</p>
<p>Let the natural-born money-makers make
money. Let us, you and me, content ourselves
with the only thing wherein we have
a prospect of sure success&mdash;that is, saving
money.</p>
<p>Sometimes the money-making faculty is
a racial heritage, as among the Hebrews.
Sometimes it runs in a family, and sometimes
it appears sporadically, and a money-making
genius crops out in the most unexpected
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
place, just as a Lincoln, a Napoleon,
or a Leonardo comes from a commonplace
environment.</p>
<p>The thing for us to remember is that getting
rich is but one small way in which human
endeavor succeeds; that those who
achieve riches are by no means certainly
happy, and that their power to acquire luxuries
is usually destructive to character.</p>
<p>And to remember also that the money-saver,
if he be intelligent and if he have
common sense and philosophy, is practically
assured of contentment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">THE SUPREME MOMENT</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;But Leonardo,&rdquo; says one writing upon
the genius of the incomparable da
Vinci, &ldquo;will never work till the happy moment
comes&mdash;that moment of bien-etre
(feeling just fit) which to imaginative men
is a moment of invention. On this moment
he waits; other moments are but a preparation
or after-taste of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are two kinds of work to be done
in the world, which may be called routine
work and creative work.</p>
<p>By routine work we mean the tending of
machines, the discharge of office duties, and
the maintenance of the ordinary; which includes
care of engines, ploughing, housework,
answering letters and keeping accounts,
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
tending the sick, digging mines,
building bridges, and the like. All these&mdash;and
the lives of all of us comprise such functions&mdash;are
to be done whether we feel like
it or not. The trombone-player in the band
must go on, though his heart is lead. The
servant must sweep the floors, no matter
how the listless Spring has got into her
blood. And the doctor must make his calls,
the policeman walk his beat, and the elevator-boy
run his car, for they are cogs in the
social wheel.</p>
<p>By creative work we mean the writing of
stories, the composition of music, the painting
of pictures, the modelling of statues, the
singing of songs, and doings of such quality.</p>
<p>These acts should await the supreme moment.
Leonardo used to rush clear across
Milan, when he was engaged in painting
&ldquo;The Last Supper&rdquo; in the little out-of-the-way
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
church of S. M. delle Grazie, just to
make three or four strokes with his brush,
to add a touch that had occurred to him.
That is one reason why the picture, now
faded, is yet epochal in art.</p>
<p>One trouble with story magazines is that
they are issued regularly. The ideal publication
would appear &ldquo;every little while.&rdquo;
One does claim to, but it is a fraud, for it
is a regular monthly.</p>
<p>What a blessing if nobody wrote a story
unless he had a story to write; if no parson
preached unless the fire burned within him;
if nobody made a political speech unless he
were as white-hot as Patrick Henry when
he gave his &ldquo;Liberty or death&rdquo; oration; if
nobody played the piano or gave forth a
song unless the compelling inspiration were
there; if nobody built a house except to realize
a beautiful dream, nor painted a picture
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
except to grasp and fix an entrancing
vision.</p>
<p>Creative work is the scarcest in the world.
And the most underpaid. And the amount
of hard work a man puts upon a thing is no
gauge of its value&mdash;often quite the contrary&mdash;for
it is the same shrewd Leonardo who
observed, <i>Quante piu un&rsquo; arte porte seco
fatica di corpo, tanto piu e vile</i>, or &ldquo;The
more bodily fatigue goes into a work of art,
the viler it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Men must work. In the forepart of the
Scriptures it is laid down that &ldquo;in the sweat
of thy face shalt thou eat bread,&rdquo; and such
labor perhaps will always be the most part
of the world&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>But in the latter part of the Scriptures it
is said that &ldquo;man shall not live by bread
alone,&rdquo; and that sustenance other than
bread, that diviner food that sustains souls,
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
and the ghost-wine that cheers them, is not
produced by sweating labor at all, should
not be called work, but is a sort of glorious
PLAY.</p>
<p>Art, craftsmanship, inspiration&mdash;no one
can work at such things; they are essentially
play, the joy (and not work, the pain) of
self-forthputting.</p>
<p>And one supreme moment is worth a lifetime.</p>

<p>Make good! Don&rsquo;t explain! Do the
thing you are expected to do! Don&rsquo;t
waste time in giving reasons why you didn&rsquo;t,
or couldn&rsquo;t, or wouldn&rsquo;t, or shouldn&rsquo;t!</p>
<p>If I hire you to cook for me I expect my
chops and baked potatoes on time, done to
a turn and appetizing; I am not interested
in the butcher&rsquo;s mistake, nor the stove&rsquo;s defect,
nor in the misery in your left arm. I
want food, not explanations. You can&rsquo;t eat
explanations.</p>
<p>If I hire you to take care of my automobile,
or factory, or shirtwaist counter, I do
not want to hear why things are half-done;
I want results.</p>
<p>So also if you come to me and hire me to
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
do a job of writing by the fifteenth of the
month, you do not want me to show up
on that day with a moving-picture story
describing how I couldn&rsquo;t do what I was
paid for. You want the writing, and you
want it first class, all wool and a yard wide.</p>
<p>This is cold, cruel, heartless talk. It is&mdash;to
all second-raters and shirkers. But to real
men it is a joy and gladness. They rejoice
to make good themselves, they expect others
to make good, and they like to hear preached
the gospel of making good.</p>
<p>Mr. Yust, the Rochester librarian, in his
report some time ago, spoke of the Parable
of the Talents, in which we are told of the
&ldquo;three servants who had received talents,
five, two and one, respectively. On the
Master&rsquo;s return they all rendered account of
their stewardship. The first two had doubled
their capital. Each of them said so in fourteen
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
words, and their work was pronounced,
&lsquo;Well done, good and faithful servant.&rsquo; Servant
number three had accomplished absolutely
nothing, but he made a full report in
forty-two words, three times as long as the
other reports.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There you have it. The less you do the

it in your sleep.</p>
<p>Of all the joys on this terrestrial sphere,
there is none quite so soul-satisfying and

GOOD.</p>

success.</p>
<p>Making good needs no foot-notes.</p>

<p>The sun may be shining when you read
this, but it was a dull day when it
was written.</p>
<p>The sky is an ugly, drab smudge. There
is no sun, no rain, no wind, nothing.</p>
<p>Across the street is a house. It is a stupid
house, full of stupid people. I know them.
I wish I didn&rsquo;t. There are many people
you are sorry to have met.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too close to have a fire and too cold
to do without one. Is anything hollower
and drearier than a fireless fireplace?</p>
<p>A bird is on a tree outdoors. He is not
singing. His head is all drawn down into
his shoulders. He is just sitting there hating
himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>A number of people have passed by the
window. They are the dullest, homeliest
bunch of human creatures I ever saw. I hate
them all.</p>
<p>A crash&mdash;the hired girl has just smashed
one of our best plates, an extra fine Sunday
plate with gold on it. The only reason I
don&rsquo;t go out and give her a dressing-down
is because I hate to move.</p>
<p>Why move? Such a day as this you are
no happier anywhere than where you are.
If you must be miserable why spread it
around?</p>
<p>Old Mrs. Grumpet has just called. She
has told the missus for the n<sup>th</sup> time about
her troubles. She has all the diseases she
ever heard of. As soon as she hears of a
new one she goes and has it. She has more
symptoms than a patent-medicine almanac.
And it&rsquo;s all along of that blue mass she took
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
just before Austey was born. She&rsquo;s a dreadful,
vast, steamy creature.</p>
<p>She has left an aroma of added wretchedness
in the house. We opened the window
to admit some fresh air, and the flies came
in. I loathe flies.</p>
<p>I chased them with a fly-swatter and
broke an expensive vase. All vases must
some day be shattered, as all men must die.</p>
<p>All women must die, too, and all children,
also all dogs, cats, horses, cows, and grizzly
bears. A hundred years from now everybody
and everything will be dead. There
will be a new crop. After awhile they, too,
will die. What&rsquo;s the use?</p>
<p>The gas-stove is out of fix this morning.
So am I. So is the universe.</p>
<p>There is no news in the paper. Newspapers
are all poor. Why read? Aren&rsquo;t you
miserable enough as you are?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>I am trying to have a vacation and enjoy

<h2 id="c19"><span class="small">THE LITTLE GOD OF HAPPY ENDINGS</span></h2>
<p>Some woman who knows how to tell a
story sends me the following:</p>
<p>This is a fairy-story, but it is not
about a princess; princesses are always
wonderfully beautiful and wise and good,
and the little girl in this story was a rather
silly little girl.</p>
<p>She lived in a little house, on a great
highway, and watched and waited for the
coming of the prince for whom all girls, big
and small, great princesses and poor silly
little spinners, watch and wait.</p>
<p>Many people passed the little house by
the roadside, as they travelled along the
great highway. Once or twice the girl who
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
watched thought she saw the prince in the
distance, but always as he approached the
likeness faded. Then came one traveller,
who tarried for a while at the little house.
He came quietly, unostentatiously, and the
prince was to come riding on a white
charger, clothed in the splendor of purple
and gold. So she hid herself under a cloak
until the traveller again set out on the great
highway, alone.</p>
<p>But after he had gone she saw that he
had left a shadow behind him, and for some
contrary, woman-reason, she hid it, and
guarded it carefully, in case he should return
and claim it.</p>
<p>The days became weeks&mdash;the weeks
months&mdash;the months years, and the prince
did not appear. Gradually she gave up the
hope of him ever appearing, and no longer
watched for him, but occupied her days instead
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
with wholesome labor. And now she
was no longer a silly little girl, but a lonely
woman.</p>
<p>One evening she stood in the doorway,
watching the sunset. The highway was
quite deserted, save for one lone traveller,
off in the distance, who seemed vaguely familiar.
As he approached, she recognized
in him the one who had tarried at her dwelling
almost five years before.</p>
<p>She went back into the house, to get the
shadow from its secret hiding-place, to return
it to him. But when she had opened
the door of the little room where she kept it
she suddenly realized that she did not want
to give it up. She had kept it so long, and
had grown so used to considering it hers,
that she never realized how precious it had
become until she had to part with it. She
went to the door once more and looked out
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
upon the highway. He was quite near now,
and as she stared at him she saw with wonder
what she had been blind to before&mdash;he
was her prince!</p>
<p>She wanted to run out to meet him, with
a great joy in her heart and a glad cry on
her lips, but she was bound by convention.
And she was filled with a great fear, lest he
should pass by, merely thinking of her as a
silly little girl who had hidden herself when
he came the first time and let him go on
alone. And she decided that, as she was
not allowed to reveal herself to him, neither
would she attempt to stop him and return
the shadow which was rightly his, but
would at least keep that, to help make the
coming years less lonely.</p>
<p>And that is the end of this fairy-story.
And after all, I am not sure that it is a
REAL fairy-story, because most fairy-stories
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
end&mdash;&ldquo;And they lived happy ever
after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps you, who are so much wiser than
the silly little woman, can think of a better
ending for it.</p>
<p class="tb">I thank you, dear unknown sender of this
tale, for your pretty compliment. If in any
way I might claim to be wiser than you, or
than any one who feels destiny has cheated
him, it is because I have ceased to seek the
shrine of the Little Cheating God of Happy
Endings, and visit rather the Great God of
Day by Day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="small">THE ART OF HAPPY MEMORY</span></h2>
<p>The most significant step a mind takes
is that wherein it realizes that it can
control its own operation; when it learns
that it can command those things in itself
commonly considered automatic.</p>
<p>And in nothing does this appear with such
striking results to happiness as in the discovery
of one&rsquo;s power to manage his
memory.</p>
<p>Most people think they remember what
they remember, and that is all there is to it.
But it is possible to make memory a servant,
and restrain its mastery.</p>
<p>In Italy a rare motto was found by Hazlitt
upon a sun-dial: <i>Horas non numero nisi
serenas</i>&mdash;&ldquo;I mark only the shining hours.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>The man whose increase of contentment
is most assured, as he grows older, is the
one who has discovered how to enjoy his
past.</p>
<p>To many of us the past is always sad.
We turn from it with impatience. &ldquo;Man
never is, but always to be, blest.&rdquo; Naturally
this habit of mind sees in the ever-shortening
future nothing but tragedy. Accept, then,
these hints on how to handle your past.</p>
<p>First, whatever it is, has been; it has
brought you here. Your condition may not
be all your impudent claims on the universe
demand, but it might be worse. Better men
than you are in jail, are stricken with unceasing
pain. Better men than you have
been hanged.</p>
<p>Out of the worst experiences you have
had you may reap satisfaction. The dangers,
sicknesses, accidents, and losses, one
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
who understands the art of living finds in
the recalling of even these a certain thankfulness.
Is there not pleasure in recounting
your narrow escape?</p>
<p>You have had your pangs and pains; but
the wise man knows that out of these have
come his richest crops of understanding.
Life has its stripes; but they are its healing.</p>
<p>The past is largely made by the present.
If you are now soured and disappointed you
are quite hopeless, for your diseased memory
will go over your past and pick out
from it only miserable things. But if you
have adjusted yourself, if with a courageous
heart you are trying to make the best of conditions
as they are, your memory will aid
you, and bring you stores of happy incidents.</p>
<p>Your past is the strongest asset of your
present judgment. It is your best teacher.
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
Only from it do you learn whatever shrewdness
you have in dealing with events.</p>
<p>Learn to forgive yourself, not in folly,
but in a sane charity. The things you did
wrong, the failures and mistakes, consider
them as part of that tutelage of destiny that
goes toward your present equipment.</p>
<p>What has happened to you has happened
to all men. The question is, will you cull
from it flowers or thorns?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything considered,&rdquo; says Renan,
&ldquo;there are few situations in the vast field of
existence where the balance of debt and
credit does not leave a little surplus of
happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have crossed the years. We are here.
We have escaped what perils! We have
landed with what residue of wisdom and of
hope!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="small">SUBCONSCIOUS FEARS</span></h2>
<p>A young man writes me that he is
afraid of thunderstorms, and asks if
there is no way for him to overcome this
weakness. &ldquo;I am normal in every other respect,&rdquo;
he adds, &ldquo;but notwithstanding my
endeavors to fight off this nervousness I find
it to be of no avail; it appears to be a sort
of subconscious fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is not a matter of ridicule, but a sample
of very real and acute suffering to which
many persons are subject by fear-panics due
to various causes.</p>
<p>Many women scream with terror at the
sight of a mouse. There is no use telling
them that mice will not hurt them. So doing,
you are addressing their reason, while
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
the trouble lies not in their intelligence&mdash;it
is a nervous disease. They scare just as a
horse shies at a newspaper flapping in the
wind.</p>
<p>C&aelig;sar Augustus was almost convulsed at
the sound of thunder.</p>
<p>Tycho Brahe changed color and his legs
shook under him on meeting a rabbit.</p>
<p>Dr. Samuel Johnson would never enter a
room left foot first.</p>
<p>Talleyrand trembled at the mention of the
word&mdash;death.</p>
<p>Marshal Saxe was mortally afraid of a
cat.</p>
<p>Peter the Great could never be persuaded
to cross a bridge, and, though he tried to
master his terror, was unable to do so.</p>
<p>I myself have never been able to rid myself
of a fear of horses, and the tamest old
nag gives me the creeps.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>And I know a senior in Wellesley College,
a young lady of strong intelligence, who
could be sent almost into convulsions by
showing her a spider or a caterpillar.</p>
<p>To determine the cause of these fear-obsessions
is a business for the psychologist.
They seem to have nothing to do with the
mind or the will, but to be, as my correspondent
suggests, rooted somewhere in the
subconsciousness.</p>
<p>That these weaknesses can be entirely
eradicated in a grown person is doubtful. It
is about as difficult to uproot an ingrained
fear as to get rid of a distaste for mutton.
Certain strong natures can perhaps cure
themselves, but the average man has to accommodate
himself to his weakness and resist
it the best he can.</p>
<p>But the cruel part of this whole matter
is that almost all of these fears are
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
TAUGHT US WHEN WE ARE CHILDREN.
Many a child&rsquo;s mind is deliberately
poisoned by fear-suggestions that are to
plague him his life long.</p>
<p>Whoever threatens a child, or frightens a
child by the fear of thunder or lightning or
the dark or ghosts or the bad man or death
or hell or a vindictive Deity, should be
flogged.</p>
<p>Many a delicate child has been more horribly
tormented by suggested fears than he
could ever have been hurt by corporal punishment.</p>
<p>The most deeply moral lesson any mother
can instil into her child is that he be UNAFRAID&mdash;of
anything in life or death.
And whoso teaches a child a fear has made
an incurable wound in his soul.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="small">LAYING UP</span></h2>
<p>The thrifty man lays up money for his
old age. The farmer lays up fodder
for his winter feeding. The medical student
lays up information for use in his
future practise. The intelligent, by due
exercise and diet, lay up health, and the
wastrel lays up trouble and disease by his
excesses.</p>
<p>All of us lay up something, willy-nilly.</p>
<p>It is a good idea to ask one&rsquo;s self, in considering
any act we are about to perform,
not only what will be the immediate pleasure
in it, but what sort of product we are laying
up for ourselves by it.</p>
<p>We are always coming into our inheritance
from our past deeds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>Maeterlinck says, &ldquo;There is one thing
that can never turn into suffering, and that
is the good we have done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This day you may have to decide between
doing a thing that will gain you a thousand
dollars and a thing that will cost you ten.
In making up your mind it is well to take
into consideration what happiness dividend
the transaction is going to bring you ten
years from now.</p>
<p>The world you live in is formed on the
laying-up principle. Nature gains her ends
as a child learns to walk and talk, by infinite
repetitions. She does the same thing
over and over. She is eternally learning
how.</p>
<p>Think how many centuries she practised
in fish-flappers, bird-wings, and animal
fore-legs until she could make a human arm.</p>
<p>Let the scientist tell you of the infinite
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
trials that preceded the formation of an eye,
an ear, a human brain.</p>
<p>The efficiency of every age depends upon
what was laid up for it by the ages gone
before. This age of coal and petroleum
rests upon the long cycles of the carboniferous
era, when summer after summer giant
trees grew and fell, and in the crucible of
earth were changed to coal and oil!</p>
<p>Nature never forgets. She never drops a
stitch. What she does now is a part of
what she has in mind for ten thousand years
from now. The plan of the oak is in the
acorn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The books were opened,&rdquo; says the
Apocalypse, describing the Day of Judgment,
&ldquo;and the dead were judged out of
the things that were written in the books.&rdquo;
This parable is but a picture of the scientist&rsquo;s
declaration that our EVERY ACT
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
LEAVES ITS RUT IN THE BRAIN,
making us prone to repeat; what we feel
today we more readily feel tomorrow; every
functioning of body or mind, in fact, having
memory-making as a by-product. The
whole process looks toward a future man.</p>
<p>Creation is cumulative. That is the
meaning of evolution.</p>
<p>The human race is cumulative. That we
learn from reading history.</p>
<p>The individual life is cumulative. Every
day is for future days. Every sensation
and every act of will, everything I do, has
a bearing upon the me that shall be ten
years from this time&mdash;a thousand, a million
years hence&mdash;who knows?</p>
<p>Hence, if any one chooses to believe that,
after this long getting-ready, Nature is going
to throw me, body and soul, back into
the scrap-heap, let him believe it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>Nature ought to have as much sense as I
have. And I certainly would not go to all
the pains Nature takes in preparing a human
spirit only to fling my product at last into
the ditch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="small">HUMAN FLIES</span></h2>
<p>Oh for a human fly-swatter! That is, for
some sort of a swatter that would
obliterate the human fly.</p>
<p>The most prominent trait of a fly is his
ability and disposition to bother. He is essential,
concentrated botheraciousness.</p>
<p>He is the arch intruder. He is the type of
the unwelcome. His business is to make you
quit what you are doing and attend to him.</p>
<p>He makes the busy cook cease her bread-making
to shoo him away. He disturbs the
sleeper to brush him off. He is president
and chairman of the executive committee of
the amalgamated association of all pesterers,
irritators, and nuisances.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>The human fly is the male or female of
the genus homo who is like the housefly.</p>
<p>Some children are flies. They are so ill
bred and undisciplined that they perpetually
annoy their mother until her nerves are frazzled,
and make life miserable for any guests
that may be in the house. It may be well to
be kind and thoughtful toward the little darlings,
but the first lesson a child should be
taught is to govern himself as not to be a
bother.</p>
<p>There are respectful, considerate, and unobtrusive
children alas&mdash;too few!</p>
<p>There are fly wives. Realizing their own
pettiness they gain their revenge by systematically
irritating the husband. They make
a weapon of their weakness. They soon acquire
the art of pestering, nipping, and buzzing,
keep the man in a perpetual temper,
and blame him for it. You can&rsquo;t talk to
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
them. Nothing can cure them but an eleven-foot
swatter. And these are not for sale.</p>
<p>Some men are just as bad. Married to
a superior woman such a man is inwardly
galled by his own conscious inferiority. So
he bedevils her in ways indirect. He enjoys
seeing her in a state of suppressed indignation.
He keeps her on edge. His persecution
is all the more unbearable because it is
the unconscious expression of his fly nature.
Also for him there is no cure but to wait
till he lights some time and swat him with
some giant, Gargantuan swatter. And
they&rsquo;re all out of these, too, at the store.</p>
<p>There are office flies, likewise, who get
into your room, occupy your extra chair,
and buzz you for an hour upon some subject
that you don&rsquo;t care a whoop in Halifax
about. Your inherent politeness prevents
you from kicking them out, humanity will
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
not let you poison them, and there is a law
against shooting them. There ought to be
an open season for office flies.</p>
<p>Where the human flies are proudest in
their function of pestiferousness, however,
is in a meeting. Wherever you have a conference,
a committee meeting, or a convention,
there they buzz, tickle, and deblatterate.
They keep the majority waiting while
they air their incoherence. They suggest,
amend, and raise objections. They never
do anything; it is their business to annoy
people who do things.</p>
<p>I do not wish to seem unkind to my fellow-creatures,
but it does seem as if to all
legislatures, conventions, and other gatherings
there should be an anteroom where the
human flies could be gently but efficaciously
swatted.</p>
<p>There are Senate flies, as well as House
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
flies, politicians whose notion of their duty
appears to be that they should vex, tantalize,
and heckle the opposing party at every point.</p>
<p>There are fly newspapers, whose only
policy seems to be petty, vicious annoyance.</p>
<p>There are fly preachers, with a cheap efficiency
in diatribe and sarcasm, and no
wholesome, constructive message.</p>
<p>There are fly school-teachers, who hector
and scold; fly pupils, who find and fasten
upon the teacher&rsquo;s sensitive spot; fly beggars,
who will not be put aside; fly reformers, who
can only make trouble; fly neighbors, who
cannot mind their own business; fly shopkeepers,
who will not let you buy what you
want.</p>
<p>And the name of the devil himself is
Beelzebub; which being interpreted means
&ldquo;Lord of Flies.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c24"><span class="small">KEEP FIT</span></h2>
<p>Ford, the automobile man, stated in his
testimony before the Industrial Commission
that he gets more and better work
out of men at eight hours a day than at ten.</p>
<p>It is a law that holds good everywhere.
The first duty of a worker is to keep himself
fit. And an hour&rsquo;s labor when he is up to
the mark, bright, keen, and enthusiastic, is
worth three hours&rsquo; effort when he is fagged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keeping everlastingly at it brings success&rdquo;
is a lying motto; it rather brings poor
results, slipshod products, and paresis.</p>
<p>Rest and recreation are the best parts of
labor. They are the height to which the
hammer is lifted; and the force of the blow
depends on that height. To go ahead without
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
let-up is to deliver only a succession of
feeble, ineffective blows.</p>
<p>Get all the sleep you can. Stay abed all
day occasionally. Learn to be lazy, to
dawdle, to enjoy an empty mind; then, when
you are called to effort, you can hit with ten
times the power.</p>
<p>The higher the quality of your work, the
more necessary it is that you approach it
only when you are at your best.</p>
<p>This is especially true of intellectual effort.
You can tell, when you read a story
or an article, whether it is tainted with exhaustion;
it is dull, lifeless putty.</p>
<p>Those who court the quality of brightness,
but do not keep their bodies in trim, often
resort to artificial stimulants. Stephen Crane
said that the best literature could be divided
into two classes: whisky and opium.</p>
<p>Intelligent people ought not need to be
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
told that this is suicide. The best form of
enthusiasm is the natural reaction of one&rsquo;s
system after a period of relaxation.</p>
<p>The pestiferous &ldquo;work-while-you-rest&rdquo;
apostles are ever after us to &ldquo;improve our
spare time,&rdquo; study French during lunch, geometry
while going to sleep, and history
during recess. But spare time ought to be
wasted, not improved.</p>
<p>An hour or so at the ball-game, a contest
at tennis, a long and aimless walk, a party
at cards, a chess match, or a time spent in
jolly talk with friends are not waste; they
mean restored strength, upbuilt mental acumen,
the doubling of efficiency when work
is to do.</p>
<p>Learn to let go. Learn to relax utterly
when you sit down. Learn to let every faculty
lie down when you lie down, and rest
whether you sleep or not.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>The more thoroughly you do nothing
when there is nothing to do, the better you
can do something when there is something
to do.</p>
<p>The very cream of life comes from rest.
The blush, the aroma, the shine of your best
work lie in the hours of idleness massed behind
it. The secret of brilliant work is in
throwing every atom of your reserve force
into it. Perpetual exertion begets mediocrity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep fit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is a better rule than &ldquo;Keep at it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<h2 id="c25"><span class="small">THE SPIRITUAL STEAM-ROLLER</span></h2>
<p>The secret of prophecy is to find what
is right, and prophesy that.</p>
<p>It is very simple. What is wrong will
go down.</p>
<p>The cosmic spiritual laws are just as accurate,
just as sure-footed, as the laws of
gravitation and chemical reaction.</p>
<p>Any institution that is founded on non-facts,
any government that is maintained in
violation of plain human rights, any system,
any propaganda, that depends upon cheating,
lying, or injustice, is certain at length
to fail.</p>
<p>The certainty of the defeat of Prussian
militarism is not based on its inferiority in
numbers, wealth, and resources, but upon
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
the moral rottenness of its ideas. It will
come to grief, not because of its lack of
force&mdash;it would make no difference if it
were a hundred times stronger&mdash;but because
it is based on principles which to humanity
are intolerable.</p>
<p>If the Hohenzollern crowd had met no
resistance in Belgium, if they had conquered
Paris as they hoped, if they had crushed
England, if they had realized to the full their
dream of dominance over Europe and the
whole world, their structure would have
crumbled just the same, because it would
have been reared upon violence, inhumanity,
faithlessness, and fraud.</p>
<p>In the little affairs of a day it seems sometimes
as if the wicked prosper. The gambler
is flush, the lecher flourishes, the swindler
gets away with his swag, and the pirate, the
assassin, and the robber feast on their booty.
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
But when this sort of thing is stretched out
over any considerable space of time or territory,
so that the cosmic laws, which move
slowly, have a chance, it is sure to break
down.</p>
<p>What we call righteousness and justice is
just as much a part of nature as the physical
laws. It is just as true and certain that lying
brings disgrace, robbery cannot be made a
permanent basis of business, uncleanness
ends in shame, tyranny brings revolution,
and cruelty eventuates in counter-cruelty
and insecurity, as that water runs down hill
and flame mounts upward.</p>
<p>It is the glory of the Hebrew that he first
saw and made clear to the world these spiritual
verities. His Bible is a book of spiritual
chemistry and physics.</p>
<p>When he said that &ldquo;the ungodly shall not
stand,&rdquo; &ldquo;the covenant with hell shall be disannulled,&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
&ldquo;though hand join in hand the
wicked shall not go unpunished,&rdquo; and &ldquo;be
not deceived, God is not mocked, for whatsoever
a man soweth, that shall he also
reap,&rdquo; he was not indulging in sentiment,
but he had a real vision of cosmic law.</p>
<p>It was the supreme genius of Jesus that
He saw the majestic certainty and fatefulness
of this law, and recommended to His
followers that they let it alone, and trust
in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vengeance is mine, I will avenge, saith
the Lord.&rdquo; Time, evolution, destiny, nature,
God&mdash;all these flow onward as irresistible
tides, and even the inventive ferocity of an
efficient nation gone mad cannot stop nor
delay them.</p>
<p>The Prussian military steam-roller could
only get so far, then it had to stop. The
steam-roller of spiritual law carries on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<h2 id="c26"><span class="small">HEAVEN</span></h2>
<p>I have discovered where heaven is.</p>
<p>Wherever you are, it is somewhere else.</p>
<p>It is the land of the unattainable, the
island that has never been discovered, the
shore no ship has ever reached.</p>
<p>Who has found that moment, spoken of
by Goethe, where one can say, &ldquo;Let this
moment last forever&rdquo;?</p>
<p>We were sitting on the top of the mountain,
on the platform in front of the little
inn, Anushka and I, looking far out over
the successive ranges of the Sierras that extended
wave-like everywhere. The sun was
brilliant. The air was warm. Around us
was spread a panorama as beautiful as mortal
eyes had ever seen. I was about to ask
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
Anushka if she was happy, when she pointed
to a spot over the farthest peaks where the
clouds touched the mountain-tops and a
gleam of sunshine blessed them, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! My soul is yonder. Do you
see that spot? It is the dwelling-place of
light ineffable. All is peace and joy there.
I think that must be heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;That is
heaven&mdash;from here. But when you get
there you will find it only mist. From here
those clouds are white and gold, and angels
fly among them. If you could reach them
you would find it bleak and cold, with only
rocks and snow-drifts and desolation about
you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then perhaps you might see, farther on
in the distance, another point full of glory.
If you flew to that you would find your
glory-point just as far away as ever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;So heaven flies before us. To us heaven
is on Venus, or Saturn, or Arcturus; to the
inhabitants of those spheres, who knows?
Maybe heaven is on Tellus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;seems a bitter view.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;It is the only
view that makes happiness eternal. The
one everlasting faculty of mankind is anticipation.
The one inexhaustible fountain
of joy is hope. Those whose happiness
is located in the land of hope will always be
happy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven is in the future, because the
future is infinite. Besides, the future is the
only time when we can be happy without
alloy. The past, even as to the pleasantest
moments of it, is always a little sad. So no
one&rsquo;s heaven is in the past. The present is
fleeting, sinking every minute into the darkness
of the past. So no man&rsquo;s heaven is in
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
the present. In the future alone is pure,
ideal, untainted joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are born pilgrims and strangers.
The birds of the air have nests, and the
foxes have holes, but man has not where
to lay his head. He is the gypsy of the
universe. He is the bird of passage of the
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I have been happy,&rdquo; protested
Anushka.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But what keys you
up to live, what stimulates and inspires you,
is not the happiness you have had, but the
happiness you expect to have.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The surest, stablest thing in life is
heaven. It rests upon the enduring stones
of hope. Its pillars are all of the alabaster
of anticipation. It is a city of eternity, not
of time. Therefore it is that its gates are
never shut, night nor day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<h2 id="c27"><span class="small">THE BEST OF LIFE</span></h2>
<p>You say, my dear Anushka, that you
have nothing but your dreams; you
are full of dreams; drunk every day with
ideals. And you speak of this as if it were
a weakness, something to be ashamed of.</p>
<p>You are young. All your years slant upward.
Before you life stretches out as a
vast untried adventure. Love is yet to
come, and success, and a career. Let me,
who am over the hillcrest and on the westering
slope, talk to you a bit.</p>
<p>And looking back on all that I have had
and felt and lived, let me say to you that the
best of all was the dream. Not what I got
but what I longed for, not what I attained
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
unto but what I aimed at, these are my
harvest, my treasures.</p>
<p>I fished in the sea, but the biggest fish got
away. I hunted in the wood, but the brightest
birds, the fleetest deer, were those I
glimpsed and saw as they vanished.</p>
<p>The things I have seen, gazed at with
full vision, were cheap and tawdry compared
to those that flashed by and were
caught only by the tail of my eye.</p>
<p>What I have done is a poor compromise.
What I dreamed of doing was wonderful.
I have composed music such as the angels
might covet to sing. I have painted pictures,
carved statues, built palaces, such as
no hands of flesh could accomplish.</p>
<p>I have said words that broke hearts with
their infinite tragedy, and healed them
again with their divine accent of consolation.
I have written books that swayed the world&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
heart as the summer wind bends the wheat-field.</p>
<p>But it was all in the realm of might-have-been,
beyond the mountains of the possible.</p>
<p>This real self I am afraid for you to
know. It is so commonplace. I am just
a man, and the worse for wear. I am not
a bit splendid nor dazzling, but by way of
being shop-worn.</p>
<p>It is only my beautiful secret that comforts
me to take of what I dreamed; it is
only this that encourages me to take my
journey hopefully among the stars when my
release comes; perhaps there, in some cozy
planet among the Pleiades, or dwelling as a
pure flame among the fire-spirits that play
about the petals of Dante&rsquo;s Rose of Heaven,
perhaps there I shall find a pot of gold at
the end of my rainbow.</p>
<p>But as far as this earthly career is concerned,
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
Anushka, the rainbow has been more
worth than the gold. Yet I am not sad
nor disillusioned, for, listen, I still have my
dreams, my skies of may-be still overarch
with infinitude my earth that is.</p>
<p>What I have is pitiful enough. Ah, but
what I thought I was getting! I am as one
who gathers shells and sea-beauties and
takes them home, and finds them withered,
yet remembers the day on the shore. You
recall what the poet said?</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I wiped away the weeds and foam,</p>
<p class="t0">I fetched my sea&mdash;born treasures home,</p>
<p class="t0">But the poor, unsightly, noisome things</p>
<p class="t0">Had left their beauty on the shore</p>
<p class="t0">With the sun and the sand and the wild uproar.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>So hold your dreams, Anushka, and never
let them go, for when you are old they will
be the best residue of life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<h2 id="c28"><span class="small">USE AND BEAUTY</span></h2>
<p>The Sabbath, said the Teacher, was
made for Man, and not man for the
Sabbath.</p>
<p>The bearin&rsquo;s of which, as Dickens would
say, is in its application.</p>
<p>Any Institution was made for Man, and
not Man for the Institution.</p>
<p>The college, for instance. No, friend
Procrustes, whilst we appreciate your zeal
to make a record for yourself as President,
yet we would remind you that we are sending
our boy to your University for the good
He can get out of it, and not for the benefit
He can be to it. He is not there for you
to find out how far He falls short of your
standards, nor what glory He can add to his
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
Alma Mater; He is there for You to find out
what&rsquo;s in Him, and to develop that. We
don&rsquo;t care a hang about your grand old traditions
and things, except as they help you in
being the making of our particular pup.</p>
<p>The Church was made for Man, and not
Man for the Church. And if your meeting-house
is just occupied in keeping itself up,
parson, why, close it up and start a hennery,
and help Hoover. We don&rsquo;t care about how
much money you raise, nor how beautiful
are your vestments, nor how high your theology,
nor how numerous your membership,
nor how gay your stained glass. Are you
helping friend Man? Are you making him
sober, industrious, clean, and honest? Are
you developing in him a civic conscience?
Or are you simply being good&mdash;so good
you&rsquo;re good for nothing? Come, produce!
Or quit!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>The House was made for Man, Ma, and
not Man for the House. Let the boys play
marbles in the dining-room, and the girls
have their beaux in the parlor, and grandpa
smoke his pipe in the kitchen, and everybody
raid the ice-box at 11 p. m. if they want to;
what better use can carpets be put to than
that children&rsquo;s knees should wear them out
a-gleemaking, and what are sofas for if not
for spooning, and kitchen-warmth and cheer
if not for old folk homing? Use the old
home up, and get a better product&mdash;of love
and laughter and undying memories.</p>
<p>Books were made for Man, and not Man
for Books. Use &rsquo;em. Thumb &rsquo;em. Mark
&rsquo;em. Go to bed with &rsquo;em. Carry &rsquo;em on
trains. And don&rsquo;t own books that cannot
be carried down through the Valley of
Every-day as the soul&rsquo;s lunch-basket.</p>
<p>The most perfect Ornament is that which
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
is of the most perfect Service to Man. No
cane is so beautiful as the one grandfather
wore smooth on a thousand walks; no chair
so lovely as that one mother consecrated by
many a night of rocking the baby; no table
so priceless as that one where father used
to write; no pipe so pretty as the one he
smoked; no dress so charming as that one
that still has the wrinkles in it worn there by
the little girl gone&mdash;gone forever into heaven,
or womanhood.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the human touch that beautifies. Nothing
can be warmly beautiful that is not, or
was not, useful.</p>
<p>And Democracy is beautiful because it
exists for the welfare of the People that
compose it, and not for the glory of the
Dynasty that rules it.</p>
<p>The State was made for Man, and not
Man for the State.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<h2 id="c29"><span class="small">THE ETHICS OF CONTROVERSY</span></h2>
<p>Everything is disputable. I am willing
to entertain arguments in support
of any proposition whatsoever.</p>
<p>If you want to defend theft, mayhem,
adultery, or murder, state your case, bring
on your reasons; for in endeavoring to prove
an indefensible thing you discover for yourself
how foolish is your thesis.</p>
<p>But it is essential to any controversy, if it
is to be of any use, first, that the issue be
clearly understood by both sides.</p>
<p>Most contentions amount merely to a difference
of definition. Agree, therefore, exactly
upon what it is you are discussing. If
possible, set down your statements in
writing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>Most argument is a wandering from the
subject, a confusion of the question, an increasing
divergence from the point. Stick
to the matter in hand.</p>
<p>When your adversary brings in subjects
not relevant, do not attempt to answer them.
Ignore them, lest you both go astray and
drift into empty vituperation.</p>
<p>For instance, President Wilson, in the
&ldquo;Lusitania&rdquo; incident, called Germany&rsquo;s attention
to the fact that her submarines had
destroyed a merchant ship upon the high
seas, the whole point being that this had
been done without challenge or search and
without giving non-combatant citizens of a
neutral country a chance for their lives.
Germany&rsquo;s reply discussed points that had
no bearing upon this issue, such as various
acts of England. Mr. Wilson, in his reply,
wisely refused to discuss these irrelevant
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
things, an example of intelligent controversy.</p>
<p>Keep cool. The worse your case, the
louder your voice.</p>
<p>Be courteous. Avoid epithets. Do not
use language calculated to anger or offend
your opponent. Such terms weaken the
strength of your position.</p>
<p>A controversy is a conflict of reasons, not
of passions. The more heat the less sense.</p>
<p>Keep down your ego. Do not boast. Do
not emphasize what you think, what you believe,
and what you feel; but try to put forth
such statements as will induce your opponent
to think, believe, and feel rationally.</p>
<p>Wait. Give your adversary all the time
he wants to vent his views. Let him talk
himself out. Wait your turn, and begin
only when he is through.</p>
<p>Agree with him as far as you can. Give
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
due weight, and a little more, to his opinions.
It was the art of Socrates, the greatest of
controversialists, to let a man run the length
of his rope, that is, to talk until he had himself
seen the absurdity of his contention.</p>
<p>Most men argue simply to air their convictions.
Give them room. Often when they
have fully exhausted their notions they will
come gently back to where you want them.
They are best convinced when they convince
themselves.</p>
<p>Avoid tricks, catches, and the like. Do
not take advantage of your opponent&rsquo;s slip
of the tongue. Let him have the impression
that you are treating him fairly.</p>
<p>Do not get into any discussion unless you
can make it a sincere effort to discover the
truth, and not to overcome, out-talk, or
humiliate your opponent.</p>
<p>Do not discuss at all with one who has his
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
mind made up beforehand. It is usually
profitless to argue upon religion, because as
a rule men&rsquo;s opinions here are reached not
by reason but by feeling or by custom. Nothing
is more interesting and profitable, however,
than to discuss religion with an open-minded
person, yet such a one is a very rare
bird.</p>
<p>If you meet a man full of egotism or prejudices,
do not argue with him. Let him
have his say, agree with him as you can,
and for the rest&mdash;smile.</p>
<p>Controversy may be made a most friendly
and helpful exercise, if it be undertaken by
two well-tempered and courteous minds.</p>
<p>Vain contention, on the contrary, is of no
use except to deepen enmity.</p>
<p>Controversy is a game for strong minds;
contention is a game for the weak and undisciplined.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<h2 id="c30"><span class="small">LETTING THINGS ALONE</span></h2>
<p>There are times, said Eb Hopkins,
when you want to Let Things Alone,
and then again there are times when you
want to Meddle.</p>
<p>I lean mostly to lettin&rsquo; &rsquo;em alone, myself.</p>
<p>As I git older I notice that most things
sorta cure &rsquo;emselves, if you leave &rsquo;em lay.</p>
<p>I used to butt in frequent when young,
but since I passed the draft age I kinda lost
my taste for fixin&rsquo; things.</p>
<p>I suppose they&rsquo;s some would call me a
coward, and a sidestepper, and an opportunist,
and a trimmer, and all that&mdash;I dunno&mdash;maybe
I am&mdash;but I&rsquo;ve had my eye on old
Mr. Time for lo, these many years, and I&rsquo;ve
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
observed that, as a mender of bones, hearts,
political differences, and religious quarrels,
he is like A. Ward&rsquo;s kangaroo, &ldquo;seldom
ekaled and never surpassed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The way to teach a boy how to swim is to
throw him into the water and go away. Then
he has to learn, right off.</p>
<p>There was old man Eustis and his wife,
over Sanford way, that had no end o&rsquo; trouble
over their boy. They was always workin&rsquo;
with him and lecturin&rsquo; him and rasslin&rsquo;
in prayer over him, and he was just carousin&rsquo;
and actin&rsquo; up like all the time; till the old
folks up and died, and then they was nobody
cared a whoop for the boy, whether he hung
hisself or not, and he had the first good spell
o&rsquo; lettin&rsquo; alone he&rsquo;d ever had in his life, and
he just turned right around and straightened
up and now he owns a bank, and is deacon
in the church, and everything.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>Of course, you can&rsquo;t always let things
alone, but in case of doubt it&rsquo;s trumps.</p>
<p>As I read history, it seems to me that
Lettin&rsquo; Folks Alone has been the secret of
the success of the English-speakin&rsquo; peoples.
Gov&rsquo;ment Control of everything from
wheat-cakes to railroads may be comin&rsquo;, and
it may be best, but I&rsquo;m personally a leetle
skittish of it.</p>
<p>The English race&rsquo;s idea of Law and Gov&rsquo;ment
is to have as leetle of &rsquo;em as possible.
The German idea is to have everything and
everybody regulated, down to drawin&rsquo; their
breath. And they&rsquo;re tryin&rsquo; it out now, to
see which idea will whip.</p>
<p>The Almighty does a heap o&rsquo; Lettin&rsquo; Folks
Alone. Anybody can go to the dogs that
wants to. The gates of the Bad Place are
open day and night. It looks to me very
much as if what saves a man must come
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
from the inside of him, and if he ain&rsquo;t got
nothin&rsquo; inside that will rouse up and save
him, he ain&rsquo;t worth savin&rsquo;, and Nature is
anxious to shovel him out in the discard just
as soon as possible.</p>
<p>So I says, Let &rsquo;em Alone. The good
ones&rsquo;ll come to the top, and the bad ones
will drown, and they&rsquo;ll make fertilizer, and
p&rsquo;raps that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re intended for.</p>
<p>Thus spake Eb Hopkins.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<h2 id="c31"><span class="small">THE PLEASURES OF OUTLAWRY</span></h2>
<p>The hand of civilization has lain hard
upon those professions wherein the
outlaw spirit once found expression. The
riproaring pirates have been swept from the
seven seas. Bandits have been chased from
the mountains. Robbers no longer infest
the woods, and smugglers have deserted the
caves. About all that is left for the poor
wicked man is the gypsy bands in the country
and the criminal class in the city.</p>
<p>Too little attention has been given to that
primeval and persistent trait of human nature,
the love of outlawry. That it is in the
blood of all of us is shown by the fact that
it breaks out in every boy. No boy wants to
be a banker or a grocer when he grows up;
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">136</span>
they all want to become pirates, bandits, or
circus clowns.</p>
<p>They are supposed to get over this as they
mature, but a lot of it still lingers under the
vests of the most respectable members of
society.</p>
<p>It is doubtful whether any human being
wants to sin. What he wants is to escape
from respectability.</p>
<p>Few men drink liquor for the love of it.
A vast deal of alcohol is consumed just because
it seems devilish. When the host tips
his guest the wink and stealthily leads the
way to the back-closet under the stairs and
produces a black bottle, how the flavor of
the liquor is improved by the vicious delight
in evading the watchfulness of the members
of the Women&rsquo;s Temperance Society gathered
in the parlor!</p>
<p>Few boys would learn to smoke if it were
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
not impressed upon them that smoking perverts
their morals and brings them to an
early grave. For just the wild waywardness
of doing something desperate they will sneak
behind the barn and make themselves sick
with father&rsquo;s pipe.</p>
<p>How many a marriage has gone wrong
because of the irrepressible desire of human
beings to make moral excursions might be
an interesting subject for speculation. There
is a cantankerous rebellion in the average
human being toward anything that is legalized,
even ecstatic bliss.</p>
<p>The criminal class is supposed to be confined
to a few low-browed persons well
known to the police. But all criminality does
not lie within this corral. There are propensities
in all of us that differ but little from
those in the professional law-breaker.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<h2 id="c32"><span class="small">JUSTICE</span></h2>
<p>There are many earnest souls occupied
in trying to do people good.</p>
<p>There are nine million societies, more or
less, organized to improve and to ameliorate.</p>
<p>There are preachers, missionaries, evangelists,
reformers, exhorters, viewers-with-pride,
and pointers-with-alarm without number
wrestling with sinners.</p>
<p>All forms of industry are booming these
days in the U. S. A., but the uplift business
is still several laps ahead.</p>
<p>It seems ungracious to say a word to any
enthusiastic person who is engaged in so
laudable an enterprise as that of rescuing
the perishing, feeding the hungry, and healing
the sick.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>And yet, when you take time to think
right through to the bottom of things, you
must come to the conclusion that there is
but one real, radical and effective way to
help your fellow-men, and that is the way
called justice.</p>
<p>If I want to redeem the world I can come
nearer my object, and do less harm, by being
just toward myself and just toward everybody
else, than by &ldquo;doing good&rdquo; to people.</p>
<p>The only untainted charity is justice.</p>
<p>Often our ostensible charities serve but
to obscure and palliate great evils.</p>
<p>Conventional charity drops pennies in the
beggar&rsquo;s cup, carries bread to the starving,
distributes clothing to the naked. Real
charity, which is justice, sets about removing
the conditions that make beggary, starvation,
and nakedness.</p>
<p>Conventional charity plays Lady Bountiful;
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
justice tries to establish such laws as
shall give employment to all, so that they
need no bounty.</p>
<p>Charity makes the Old Man of the Sea
feed sugar-plums to the poor devil he is
riding and choking; justice would make him
get off his victim&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>Conventional charity piously accepts
things as they are, and helps the unfortunate;
justice goes to the legislature and
changes things.</p>
<p>Charity swats the fly; justice takes away
the dung-heaps that breed flies.</p>
<p>Charity gives quinine in the malarial
tropics; justice drains the swamps.</p>
<p>Charity sends surgeons and ambulances
and trained nurses to the war; justice struggles
to secure that internationalism that will
prevent war.</p>
<p>Charity works among slum wrecks; justice
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">141</span>
dreams and plans that there be no more
slums.</p>
<p>Charity scrapes the soil&rsquo;s surface; justice
subsoils.</p>
<p>Charity is affected by symptoms; justice
by causes.</p>
<p>Charity assumes evil institutions and customs
to be a part of &ldquo;Divine Providence,&rdquo;
and tearfully works away at taking care of
the wreckage; justice regards injustice everywhere,
custom-buttressed and respectable
or not, as the work of the devil, and vigorously
attacks it.</p>
<p>Charity is timid and is always passing the
collection-box; justice is unafraid and asks
no alms, no patrons, no benevolent support.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is presumed,&rdquo; says Henry Seton
Merriman, &ldquo;that the majority of people are
willing enough to seek the happiness of
others; which desire leads the individual to
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">142</span>
interfere with his neighbor&rsquo;s affairs, while it
burdens society with a thousand associations
for the welfare of mankind or the raising
of the masses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The best part of the human race does not
want help, nor favor, nor charity; it wants
a fair chance and a square deal.</p>
<p>Charity is man&rsquo;s kindness.</p>
<p>Justice is God&rsquo;s.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
